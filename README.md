A simple Pokédex application that uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to provide the user information about all the Pokémons on the [National Pokédex](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number)

## How to find a Pokémon 🔎
You can find any Pokémon on the homepage where they are ordered by their National Pokédex number;<br /> 
Or by searching by name or National Pokédex number;<br />
Or even by clicking on a Pokémon to see its details and clicking in one of his types to see all Pokémons of that type.
